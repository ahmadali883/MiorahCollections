# Authentication Flow Fix

## Problem
Unregistered users were being redirected to the login page when trying to browse public pages (home, products, collections, etc.). This was preventing visitors from exploring the site without creating an account.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the axios interceptor in `client/src/index.js`. It was redirecting users to the login page for ANY 401/403 HTTP response, even when browsing public pages.

## Solution
### 1. Updated Axios Interceptor
Modified the interceptor to be more selective about when to redirect to login:
- Only redirects when accessing protected routes that require authentication
- Allows 401/403 responses on public pages without redirecting
- Maintains security for protected routes

### 2. Updated Header Component
Fixed the Header component to avoid unnecessary authenticated API calls:
- Only calls `getUserDetails()` when there's a valid token
- Prevents 401 errors for unregistered users

### 3. Route Classification
Clear distinction between public and protected routes:

**Public Routes (No Authentication Required):**
- `/` - Home page
- `/products` - Products listing
- `/products/:id` - Individual product pages
- `/collections` - Collections page
- `/categories` - Categories page
- `/about` - About page
- `/contact` - Contact page

**Protected Routes (Authentication Required):**
- `/user-profile` - User profile and settings
- `/checkout` - Checkout process
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:
```bash
npm run test:auth-flow
```

## Expected Behavior
### For Unregistered Users:
✅ Can browse all public pages without login prompts
✅ Can view products and collections
✅ Can add items to cart (stored locally)
✅ Will be prompted to login only when accessing protected features

### For Registered Users:
✅ Can access all public pages
✅ Can access protected routes after login
✅ Cart data syncs with database
✅ Order history and profile accessible

## Implementation Details
- **Axios Interceptor**: Now checks current route before redirecting
- **Protected Routes Detection**: Uses route path matching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for authentication errors
- **Cart Functionality**: Works for both registered and unregistered users

## Files Modified
- `client/src/index.js` - Updated axios interceptor
- `client/src/components/layout/Header.jsx` - Fixed unnecessary API calls
- `test/authFlowTest.js` - Added comprehensive testing

This fix ensures a smooth user experience for visitors while maintaining security for protected features.

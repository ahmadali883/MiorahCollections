# Deleted User Handling Fix

## Problem
When a user was deleted from the database, the frontend still had the user token and info stored in localStorage/Redux state. This caused the application to show "Page Not Found" error when trying to access the user profile, instead of gracefully handling the invalid user state.

## Root Cause
1. User deleted from database by admin
2. Frontend still had `userToken` and `userInfo` in localStorage
3. Routes were conditionally rendered based on `userInfo` existence
4. API calls to user-related endpoints (like `/cart/{userId}`, `/orders/{userId}`) failed with 404/400
5. The axios interceptor wasn't properly detecting and handling these failures
6. No cleanup of invalid user data from localStorage and Redux state

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Axios Interceptor (`client/src/utils/axiosConfig.js`)
- Added better detection for user-related endpoint failures
- Added specific handling for 404/400 errors on auth endpoints
- Added proper dispatch of `clearInvalidUser` action
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Detect user-related endpoint failures
const userRelatedEndpoints = ['/auth', '/users/', '/cart/', '/orders/', '/address/', '/user/'];
const isUserRelatedEndpoint = userRelatedEndpoints.some(endpoint => 
  requestUrl.includes(endpoint)
);

// Clear invalid user data and dispatch action
if ((isUserRelatedEndpoint && isUserProtectedRoute) || (isAuthEndpoint && appError.status === 400)) {
  localStorage.removeItem('userToken');
  localStorage.removeItem('userInfo');
  localStorage.removeItem('tokenTimestamp');
  
  const store = window.__REDUX_STORE__;
  if (store) {
    store.dispatch({ type: 'auth/clearInvalidUser' });
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced UserProfile Component (`client/src/pages/User/UserProfile.jsx`)
- Added `useEffect` hook to detect invalid user states
- Added proper redirect to login when user becomes invalid
- Added loading states and user-friendly error messages
- Added better error state handling

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Handle case when user becomes invalid
useEffect(() => {
  if (!userToken) {
    navigate("/login", { 
      state: { message: "Please log in to access your profile." } 
    });
    return;
  }
  
  if (userToken && !userInfo && error) {
    navigate("/login", { 
      state: { message: "Your session has expired. Please log in again." } 
    });
    return;
  }
}, [userToken, userInfo, error, navigate]);
```

### 3. Enhanced MyRoutes Component (`client/src/routes/MyRoutes.jsx`)
- Added proper conditional rendering based on both `userToken` AND `userInfo`
- Added nested routes for profile pages
- Added backward compatibility with legacy `/user-profile` route

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Protected routes - require both token and userInfo
{userToken && userInfo && (
  <>
    <Route path="/profile" element={<UserProfile />}>
      <Route index element={<MyAccount />} />
      <Route path="orders" element={<MyOrders />} />
      // ... other nested routes
    </Route>
  </>
)}
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling (`client/src/utils/errorHandler.js`)
- Added missing error types (`BAD_REQUEST`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`)
- Updated error messages and classifications
- Made error handling more consistent across the application

### 5. Auth Slice (`client/src/redux/reducers/authSlice.js`)
- The `clearInvalidUser` action was already properly implemented
- Clears all user data and sets appropriate error state

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Login to the application
2. Note the user ID from API calls in browser console
3. Delete the user from database (MongoDB/admin panel)
4. Navigate to `/user-profile` or `/profile`
5. Verify user is redirected to login, not "Page Not Found"
6. Check console for proper error handling logs

### Expected Behavior:
âœ… No "Page Not Found" error displayed  
âœ… User redirected to login with clear message  
âœ… localStorage cleared of invalid user data  
âœ… Redux state cleared properly  
âœ… No infinite API call loops  
âœ… Proper error logging in console  

### Debug Console Messages:
- `ðŸš¨ User-related endpoint failed - user may have been deleted`
- `ðŸš¨ Dispatching clearInvalidUser action`
- `User profile: Token exists but no userInfo - redirecting to login`
- `ðŸš¨ Authentication error on protected route - clearing user data`

## User Experience
- User sees loading state briefly
- User sees friendly error message (not technical errors)
- User is redirected to login page automatically
- User can login with valid credentials
- No confusion or broken UI states

## Technical Implementation
The fix implements a comprehensive error handling flow:

1. **API Call Fails** â†’ User-related endpoint returns 404/400
2. **Axios Interceptor** â†’ Detects failure and clears invalid data
3. **Redux Action** â†’ `clearInvalidUser` updates application state
4. **Component Detection** â†’ UserProfile detects invalid state
5. **User Redirect** â†’ Navigate to login with appropriate message

This ensures robust handling of deleted user scenarios while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## Future Enhancements
- Add server-side session validation
- Implement real-time user status checking
- Add user account suspension handling
- Add more granular error messages for different scenarios

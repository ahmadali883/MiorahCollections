# Admin Dashboard Functionality Fix

## Problem Analysis
The admin dashboard had several API endpoint issues that could cause 404 errors and prevent proper functionality. The main issue was incorrect API endpoint URLs in the frontend components.

## Root Cause
The axios configuration in `client/src/utils/axiosConfig.js` sets a baseURL of `/api`, but the frontend components were adding `/api/` again to their endpoints, causing URLs like `/api/api/users` instead of `/api/users`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. AdminManager Component (`client/src/components/admin/AdminManager.jsx`)
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ `GET /api/users` → ✅ `GET /users`
- ❌ `PUT /api/users/:id/admin` → ✅ `PUT /users/:id/admin`

**Functionality:**
- List all users with search capability
- Toggle admin status for users
- Real-time status updates
- Proper error handling

### 2. CategoryForm Component (`client/src/components/admin/CategoryForm.jsx`)
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ `GET /api/categories` → ✅ `GET /categories`
- ❌ `POST /api/categories` → ✅ `POST /categories`
- ❌ `PUT /api/categories/:id` → ✅ `PUT /categories/:id`
- ❌ `DELETE /api/categories/:id` → ✅ `DELETE /categories/:id`

**Functionality:**
- Create new categories
- Edit existing categories
- Delete categories
- Form validation and reset

### 3. ProductUploadForm Component (`client/src/components/admin/ProductUploadForm.jsx`)
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ `GET /api/categories` → ✅ `GET /categories`
- ✅ `POST /products/upload` (already correct)

**Functionality:**
- Upload products with multiple images
- Category selection
- Price and inventory management
- Image preview functionality

### 4. UserProfile Component (`client/src/pages/User/UserProfile.jsx`)
**Added Admin Dashboard Link:**
- Conditional rendering for admin users only
